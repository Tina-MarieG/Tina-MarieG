- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tina-MarieG 
- 👀 I’m interested in becoming my own boss in my current field of hair styling/coloring and being a life coach and becoming certified and helping people who have trauma from having been in an abusive relationship and understanding all types of abuse, not just physical. ALSO, helping anyone who has trouble stopping their substance abuse problem because they have not dealt with the court issue of why they are using that substance in the first place, and help navigate any unknown childhood trauma that I can help them tap into..
- 🌱 I’m currently learning psychology behind abusive relationships & the hard knocks of life when you keep the wrong ppl with the wrong vibes in your personal energy space...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on well, cross promoting in the hair industry and life coaching if I'm able to gain more knowledge working with people in the mental health field...
- 📫 How to reach me ... you can email me at tinagregoria@hotmail.com
